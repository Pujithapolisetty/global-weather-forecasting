#  Global Weather Forecasting  
### Predicting Weather Conditions with Machine Learning  

##  Project Overview  
This project applies **machine learning models** to predict weather conditions based on historical climate data. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.  

###  Key Features:  
✅ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Forecasting Models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Ensemble)  
✅ Model Evaluation & Performance Metrics  
✅ Visualization of Insights
